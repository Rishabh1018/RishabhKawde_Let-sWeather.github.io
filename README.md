<h1>Hey everyone :wave:</h1>
This project is a weather app, made for a recruitment process of E-cell.
<br>
I have used api to get real-time data from weatherapi.com
<br>
Link for weather api website : https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/
<br>
<h2>Flow of app</h2>
1. Input: location name
<br>
2. Api will take your request and search your location on weather api database.
<br>
3. If data is there for your provided location it will bring back to you in the for of JSON and will change the values according to it.
<br>
4. If the data is not there it will generate an error. It can hendel any type of error.
